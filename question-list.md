# Good Question List

1. Excel Sheet Column Title  -- Observation of Regularity

2. **\*\*Linked List Cycle II** -- Observation and find the relation of Number

3. Happy Number -- Observation and Take the property of "Cycle"

4. Palindrome Number -- Based on the definition

5. Counting Bits -- Observation of Regularity and Find out the Reused place

6. Single Number II -- bitwise shift about the sign "&gt;&gt;&gt;" and "&gt;&gt;" [http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-shift-operators-in-java/](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-shift-operators-in-java/)

7. Max Points on a Line -- When it comes up with fraction, keep it in the lowest term might be the best choice without any distortion, eg. 200000000001/20000000000   and   200000000002/20000000001

8. Ugly Number -- Observation and try not to directly solve the question in a fastest way, try brute force method first.

9. Bulb Switcher -- Math

10. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation -- Switch can use in String after Java 7

11. Shuffle an Array -- How to copy the array

12. Largest Number -- Comparator of Integer and int array might meet problems,    Hard to get the rule for create the comparator for string

13. K-diff Pairs in an Array -- Write the tree figure for if and else analysis. Need to care about the order of put current number to map

14. Find All Duplicates in an Array -- The limitation of number in array imply it is kind of index. If you want to use a look function table, combining it with original array is a good option. But needs to figure out how.

15. Find the Duplicate Number -- The limitation of number in array imply it is kind of index. There is only one element appear multiple times imply that we only need to find out that number by using the property of cycle.

16. Rotate Array: Observation
